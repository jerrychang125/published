1) Install Mori's superpixel code
2) Instral Bayes Net Toolbox
3) Change paths and folders determined in "main_ITSBNImageSegm.m" and run the program.

This is similar to ITSBN in my previous post

except that this use Mori's superpixel which produces faster, smoother and more meaningful superpixels than QuickShift given the same number of superpixels.

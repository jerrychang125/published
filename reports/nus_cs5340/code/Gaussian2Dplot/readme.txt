1) run Example1.m
2) after that read it and you will know how to do it.
3) Enjoy!

Example1.m shows how to use function plotContourBackgroundGaussian2D to plot several Gaussian with contour and background.

Example2.m shows how to make contour and shaded Gaussian plot from scratch. The result of Example2 is equivalent to that of Example1.

plotGaussianContour2D.m is a fucntion to plot the contour of Gaussian

plotContourBackgroundGaussian2D.m plots both background and contour of Gaussian

This code is developed on the original code ellipse.m by D.G. Long, Brigham Young University.
